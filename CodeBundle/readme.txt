So, you found the source, huh?  Well goody for you!

Each chapter, three through seven, has a corresponding project here:

Chapter 3 - Code Cabinet
Chapter 4 - Local Business Search
Chapter 5 - Engineer
Chapter 6 - Twitter Monitor
Chapter 7 - Time Tracker

And, as an added bonus to the first 50 downloaders, a Hello World project!  How's that
for getting your moneys' worth?!?

Each of these is an Eclipse project that you *should* be able to just import into your
workspace and getting going with.  Since each follows the webOS standard structure
however, you should be able to play with them just fine with nothing but the SDK and
a command line, Eclipse should *not* be, strictly-speaking, required.

Also, I've included the IPKs for each of these if you want to quickly install them
onto your Pre (using something like webOS QuickInstall or whatnot).

Ok, well, I'm off to try and get my band back in the top 100 online in Rock Band 2.
Enjoy the code and the book!
