    Your job as the engineer of the starship Prenterprise (hehe) is to direct 
    particles created by the generator in the center of the screen into the 
    correct injector port at the corners based on color. You do this by tapping 
    the particle diverters around the generator, or by pressing the 
    keys W, A, S and Z which correspond to the top, left, right and bottom
    diverters respectively, to cycle through the diverter states. Choose the 
    right one to complete the circuit and thereby keeping a particle moving. 
    If a particle goes into the wrong port, or back into the generator, or hits 
    a diverter with an incorrect state and cannot continue, you lose points.
    Also, when they go back into the generator, or the wrong port, the engine 
    heats up a little. The bar below the play area fills up as the engine gets 
    hotter. Tap the game area somewhere other than the diverters, or press P,
    or physically shake your Pre, to cool the engine down a bit.  The game ends 
    if the engine overheats.
